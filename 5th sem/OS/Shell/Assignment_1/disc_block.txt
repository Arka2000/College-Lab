                    
The whole story can be divided into 2 parts: the Child's world and the Adult' s world.The first part of the plot is the Adult’s world which is dull, unimaginative and misunderstanding.
 The Adult’s world is full of warped priorities.
 Adults become obsessed with insignificant trivialities, like the way adult are so obsessed about punishing and nitpicking on the children. Their methods of bringing up are rather military and religious.

They put punishment and withholding of enjoyment are as more important than getting to know and molding the lives of the children. They keep all the beautiful and creative things of the house locked away in a lumber-room so as not to spoil them but in doing so,the purpose of the objects which is to beauty the house, is lost, leaving the house dull andcolourless.

 The second part of the plot describes the Child’s world. It is full of fun and imagination. They are very imaginative. They imagines the whole story behind the objects while the adult comes out with boring stories and ideas like about circus or going to the beach.
